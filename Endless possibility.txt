Lyrics and chords: 

This is my escape

I'm running through this world
            A
And I'm not looking back 
 
       E
'Cause I know I can go 
 
Where no one's ever gone
            A
And I'm not looking back 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
   C#m         B           E
But how will I know when I get there? 
   C#m         B            E
And how will I know when to leave? 
      C#m        B          E
We've all got to start from somewhere 
                          A 
And it's right there for me 
                      B
The possibilities are never ending 
 
[Chorus]
E                    A
I see it, I see it 
                           C#m
And now it's all within my reach 
        B        A   B
Endless possibility 
E                    A
I see it, I see it now 
                           C#m
It's always been inside of me 
    B             A
And now I feel so free 
        B
Endless possibility 
 
[Interlude]
E A
 
[Verse 2]
E
And so I'll carry on 
 
My time to shine has come
  A
I feel it 
 
E
As fast as I can go 
 
Straight to the top I know
       A
You’ll see it
 
[Pre-Chorus]
   C#m            B         E
So please wake me up when I get there? 
   C#m            B         E
It feels like I’m lost in a dream 
  C#m        B               E
I know in my heart that it’s my time 
              A
And I already see 
                      B
The possibilities are never ending 
 
[Chorus]
E                    A
I see it, I see it 
                           C#m
And now it's all within my reach 
        B        A   B
Endless possibility 
E                    A
I see it, I see it now 
                           C#m
It's always been inside of me 
    B             A
And now I feel so free 
        B
Endless possibility
