[Intro]
C

[Verse 1]
Fmaj7         G
 Every time I think of you
         Em                        Fmaj7
 I get a shot right through into a bolt of blue
         Fmaj7                       G
 It's no problem of mine, but it's a problem I find
 Em                           Fmaj7
 Living the life that I can't leave behind

Fmaj7                G
 There's no sense in telling me
     Em                       Fmaj7
 The wisdom of the fool won't set you free
                Fmaj7                          G
 But that's the way that it goes and it's what nobody knows
 Em           Fmaj7
 Every day my confusion grows

[Chorus]
Fmaj7         G
 Every time I see you falling
    Em             Fmaj7
 I'll get down on my knees and pray
                    G 
 I'm waiting for the final moment
    Em                   Fmaj7     C
 You say the words that I can't say

[Verse 2]
Fmaj7           G
 I feel fine and I feel good
Em                  Fmaj7
 I'm feeling like I never should
         Fmaj7                         G
 Whenever I get this way, I just don't know what to say
              Em                       Fmaj7
 Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday?

Fmaj7              G
 I'm not sure what this could mean
Em                    Fmaj7
 I don't think you're what you seem
      Fmaj7                     G
 I do admit to myself that if I hurt someone else

           Em                  Fmaj7
 Then I'll never see just what we're meant to be

[Chorus]
Fmaj7         G
 Every time I see you falling
    Em             Fmaj7
 I'll get down on my knees and pray
                    G 
 I'm waiting for the final moment
    Em                   Fmaj7     C
 You say the words that I can't say

Fmaj7         G
 'Coz every time I see you falling
    Em             Fmaj7
 I'll get down on my knees and pray
                    G 
 I'm waiting for the final moment
    Em                   Fmaj7     
 You say the words that I can't say

[Solo]
Fmaj7 G Em Fmaj7
Fmaj7 G Em Fmaj7

[Ending Chorus]
Fmaj7         G
 'Coz every time I see you falling
    Em             Fmaj7
 I'll get down on my knees and pray
                    G 
 I'm waiting for the final moment
    Em                          C
 You say the words that I can't say
